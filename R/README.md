# triform

Attempt at reviving the triform algorithm, perhaps the best punctuate peak finder (think transcription factors).

This is done in my free time (which I do not have much of), so it will move along at a leisurely pace.

#### TODO

The list will grow as I discover more stuff that needs to be done. Feel free to add your own.

- Take input/chip files as command line arguments (easy)
- Do not require input files to follow a naming convention (easy)
- Do not use temp-files, keep data in memory (to speed up the algorithm and avoid file paths in the code) (medium)
- Run chromosomes in parallel (unknown difficulty)
- Accept an arbitrary number of chip and input-files (hard?)

[The Triform algorithm: improved sensitivity and specificity in ChIP-Seq peak finding](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-176)

#### Questions
- what is the consistency check?
